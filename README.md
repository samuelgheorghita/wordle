# Wordle

## Description

I developed a word-based game where the player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Feedback is given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. This is one of the first projects I have done in React and it made me passionate and curious to learn more about it.
